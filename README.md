This repository contains a sample project that is developed using the clean architecture with compose and multi-module features

### `Why clean architecture is needed` üìë

</p>

* **Scalability**: When new features are added, using the clean architecture we can easily add the new features and maintain old existing features without breaking them.
* **Testability**: For the new features, its essential we write a code that can be tested for all possible inputs so that once in production we can forecast all possible scenarios and handle them.
* **Understandable**: Scaling a product with keeping the code testable is good but its also should be in such a way that everyone should understand it and also should easily be modify it.

### `Advantages and Disadvantages of multi module architecture` üìë
#### `Advantages` 
| `Clear separation` | `Faster build time` |
| ------------ | -------------- |
| ‚Ä¢ Each of the modules is a library and it can depend on each other <br> ‚Ä¢ If there is a scenario where one library is not dependent on another, Then they can't access each other <br> ‚Ä¢ Thus, instead of adding terms of separate packages in the app module, we can enforce strict modularity by modularising it <br> ‚Ä¢ In a large project and big team we can enforce, who works on which project. Thus one person working on one won't affect other modules| ‚Ä¢ Using the multi-module we can decrease the build time. When in multi-module each module will use separate threads so build time will decrease since all modules will build independently <br> ‚Ä¢ Since Gradle needs to build the module that has been changed, it doesn't need to make the modules that have not been changed <br> ‚Ä¢ Point to note here is that, say there is a root module with few child modules, if the root module changes, all the child modules also need to rebuild <br> ‚Ä¢ Support for `instant apps` and `dynamic feature module` <br> ‚Ä¢ Using this we can make parts of our app reusable |

#### `Disadvantages` 
 ‚Ä¢ Lot of initial code <br>
 ‚Ä¢ Not knowing what problem it will cause
